// Replay harness for the WhatsApp bot's reading of real messages.
//
// Why this exists: on 9 September four bugs shipped in one afternoon and every
// one of them was found by a human reading logs after a customer had already
// been failed. Fernando asked which metro and got a service menu. Asim asked
// for 7pm while two studios had offered exactly that. TornaSol answered
// "19 horas" and it parsed to nothing. Each of those is one line in this file
// now, and `npm run replay` fails if any of them comes back.
//
// Every case below is a real message from a real conversation, with the date
// it happened. Add the message, not a paraphrase, whenever something is missed.
//
// Run: node tests/replay.mjs
// This tests the lexicon in copy.ts, which is what decides how a message is
// read before any model or network call happens.
